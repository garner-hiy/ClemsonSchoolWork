This COBOL program is designed to perform currency conversion for freight amounts. The program retrieves data from various records in an IDMS database, including the LOAD, BUSINESS, and CURRENCY-CONV records. The program's main goal is to convert the freight amount from the input record (DNWMX830) to the currency of the bill-to business based on the order type. 

The program starts by binding and reading the required areas, including the CURRENCY-FACTOR and CURRENCY-CONV records. It then performs a currency conversion based on the order type. If the order type is 'A' or '3', the program retrieves the currency code for the bill-to business and then gets the currency conversion record for that business. It then retrieves the currency factor record with an effective date less than or equal to the current date and uses this factor to convert the freight amount. The program also handles errors and exceptions, such as if the load record is not found or if the currency factor record is not found. 

The program appears to be part of a larger system for managing ocean freight charges, and its purpose is to provide a way to convert freight amounts to the currency of the bill-to business for a given order.
