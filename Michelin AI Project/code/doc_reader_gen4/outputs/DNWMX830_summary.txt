The program is a COBOL program that appears to be a part of a larger system used for processing shipments and invoices. The program interacts with various database tables and performs various tasks such as storing data, updating records, and calling other programs.

The program starts by initializing various variables and performing a bind operation to bind the necessary database tables. It then enters a loop where it processes each record received from the WICS program, which is called WSC-DATA-RECORD. The program uses a switch statement to determine the type of record being processed and performs the corresponding actions.

The program has several sections that process different types of records, including:

1. Type 01: This section processes a shipment confirmation transaction set and calls the DNWXP261 program to get a detail record.
2. Type 02: This section processes a shipment confirmation transaction set and calls the DNWXP261 program to get a detail record.
3. Type 03: This section processes a shipment confirmation transaction set and calls the DNWXP261 program to get a detail record.
4. Type 04: This section processes a shipment confirmation transaction set and calls the DNWXP261 program to get a detail record.

The program also has several routines that perform various tasks, such as:

1. 1110000-PROCESS-LOAD: This routine processes a shipment confirmation transaction set and stores a load record.
2. 1120000-PROCESS-BOL: This routine processes a shipment confirmation transaction set and stores a bill of lading record.
3. 1130000-PROCESS-SHIP-HDR: This routine processes a shipment confirmation transaction set and stores a shipment header record.
4. 1140000-PROCESS-LINE: This routine processes a shipment confirmation transaction set and stores a shipment line record.

The program also has several subroutines that perform specific tasks, such as:

1. 1135000-GET-SHIP-NUMBER: This subroutine gets the shipment number for a sales order.
2. 1136000-CALCULATE-IRD-ETA: This subroutine calculates the IRD and ETA dates for a shipment.
3. 1137000-CALL-NDR-ROUTINE: This subroutine calls a routine to calculate the date using a known date.
4. 1144000-LOGICAL-STOCK: This subroutine processes a shipment line and updates the logical stock records.
5. 1145000-CONSIGNMENT: This subroutine adds the
