Here is the breakdown of the COBOL file into sections, along with a description of what each section accomplishes:

1. **Identification Division**: This section contains metadata about the program, including its name, author, and copyright information.

2. **Environment Division**: This section defines the environment in which the program will run, including the input/output sections and file control.

   * **Input-Output Section**: This section defines the input/output operations that the program will perform, including the files it will read and write.
   * **File-Control**: This section defines the file control operations, including the selection of the file, organization, access mode, and record key.

3. **Data Division**: This section defines the data used by the program, including the file layouts and working storage variables.

   * **File Section**: This section defines the layout of the file that the program will read and write.
   * **Working-Storage Section**: This section defines the working storage variables used by the program, including the status of the file operations and error handling variables.

4. **Procedure Division**: This section contains the program logic, including the main program flow and subroutines.

   * **0000-CARDFILE-OPEN**: This subroutine opens the file for input.
   * **1000-CARDFILE-GET-NEXT**: This subroutine reads the next record from the file.
   * **9000-CARDFILE-CLOSE**: This subroutine closes the file.
   * **9999-ABEND-PROGRAM**: This subroutine abends the program in case of an error.
   * **9910-DISPLAY-IO-STATUS**: This subroutine displays the status of the file operations.

5. **Footer**: The footer contains version and date information about the program.
