Here is a 10 sentence summary of the COBOL file:

The program CBTRN01C is a batch COBOL program designed to post records from a daily transaction file. The program uses five files: DALYTRAN-FILE, CUSTOMER-FILE, XREF-FILE, CARD-FILE, and ACCOUNT-FILE. The program opens all five files at the beginning and closes them at the end. It reads the DALYTRAN-FILE one record at a time, and for each record, it performs a lookup in the XREF-FILE to verify the card number. If the card number is verified, it reads the corresponding account record from the ACCOUNT-FILE. If the account record is found, it displays the transaction record and the account information. If the card number cannot be verified or the account record is not found, it displays an error message and skips the transaction. The program uses a procedure division to perform the main logic, and it uses a working-storage section to store variables and status codes. The program uses a copy statement to include several external files (CVTRA06Y, CVCUS01Y, CVACT03Y, CVACT02Y, and CVACT01Y) that contain common variables and procedures. The program uses a CALL statement to call a subroutine (CEE3ABD) to abend the program in case of an error. The program uses a DISPLAY statement to display messages and status codes throughout its execution.
