This COBOL program is divided into several sections:

1. **Identification Division**: This section contains information about the program, such as its name, date written, and date compiled.

2. **Environment Division**: This section defines the environment in which the program will run, including the input/output section.

3. **Data Division**: This section defines the data used by the program, including working storage, file records, and data structures.

4. **Working-Storage Section**: This section contains variables and data that are used by the program during its execution.

5. **Procedure Division**: This section contains the logic of the program, including the main program, procedures, and function calls.

**Main Program**

The main program is the entry point of the program. It is responsible for handling the program's flow of control and performing the necessary tasks.

**PFKey Storage**

The program stores the PFKey in a common area using the `CSSTRPFY` copybook.

**Screen Initialization**

The program initializes the screen using the `CACTVWAO` mapset and map. It sets up the screen title, date, and time.

**Setup Screen Variables**

The program sets up the screen variables, including the account filter and customer filter. It also sets up the search criteria and error messages.

**Setup Screen Attributes**

The program sets up the screen attributes, including the cursor position, color, and protection.

**Send Screen**

The program sends the screen to the terminal using the `EXEC CICS SEND` statement.

**Receive Map**

The program receives the map from the terminal using the `EXEC CICS RECEIVE` statement.

**Edit Map Inputs**

The program edits the map inputs, including the account ID and customer ID. It checks for errors and sets the return code and message accordingly.

**Read Account Data**

The program reads the account data from the `ACCTDAT` file using the `EXEC CICS READ` statement.

**Read Customer Data**

The program reads the customer data from the `CUSTDAT` file using the `EXEC CICS READ` statement.

**Error Handling**

The program handles errors that occur during the execution of the program, including file errors and invalid inputs.

**Return**

The program returns to the calling program using the `EXEC CICS RETURN` statement.
