The COBOL code can be broken down into several sections:

1. **IDENTIFICATION DIVISION**: This section contains information about the program, including its name, author, and copyright information.

2. **ENVIRONMENT DIVISION**: This section defines the input/output devices and files used by the program.

   * INPUT-OUTPUT SECTION: This subsection defines the input/output files used by the program.
   * FILE-CONTROL: This subsection defines the control blocks for the input/output files.

3. **DATA DIVISION**: This section defines the data used by the program.

   * FILE SECTION: This subsection defines the file layouts for the input/output files.
   * WORKING-STORAGE SECTION: This subsection defines the working storage variables used by the program.
   * 01 COMP-VARIABLES: This group defines COMP variables, which are binary variables.
   * 01 COMP3-VARIABLES: This group defines COMP-3 variables, which are 3-byte binary variables.
   * 01 MISC-VARIABLES: This group defines miscellaneous variables.
   * 01 WS-M03B-AREA: This group defines a working storage area for the M03B subroutine.
   * 01 STATEMENT-LINES: This group defines the lines of the statement to be printed.
   * 01 HTML-LINES: This group defines the lines of the HTML output.

4. **LINKAGE SECTION**: This section defines the linkage between the program and the M03B subroutine.

5. **PROCEDURE DIVISION**: This section contains the program logic.

   * 0000-START: This is the main entry point of the program.
   * 1000-MAINLINE: This is the main loop of the program, which reads the input files and processes the data.
   * 8100-FILE-OPEN: This is a branch that opens the input files.
   * 8200-XREFFILE-OPEN: This is a branch that opens the XREFILE.
   * 8300-CUSTFILE-OPEN: This is a branch that opens the CUSTFILE.
   * 8400-ACCTFILE-OPEN: This is a branch that opens the ACCTFILE.
   * 8500-READTRNX-READ: This is a branch that reads the TRNXFILE.
   * 9100-TRNXFILE-CLOSE: This is a branch that closes the TRNXFILE.
   * 9200
