This COBOL program appears to be a CICS (Customer Information Control System) program written in COBOL. It is designed to list transactions from a file named TRANSACT. 

The program's primary function is to display a list of transactions to the user and allow them to navigate through the list using PF7 (previous) and PF8 (next) keys. The user can also select a transaction to view more information about it.

Here is a 10 sentence summary of the program:

The program starts by initializing variables and setting up the environment. It then checks if the EIBCALEN (Environment Information Block, Character Length) is 0, which indicates the end of the input data. If not, it processes the input data and calls the CICS XCTL (Execute Control) to execute the next program in the sequence. The program then checks for user input and performs actions based on the input. It uses the CICS READNEXT and READPREV commands to read the next and previous records from the TRANSACT file, respectively. The program also uses the CICS STARTBR and ENDBR commands to start and end the browse of the TRANSACT file. The program displays a list of transactions to the user and allows them to navigate through the list using PF7 and PF8 keys. The program uses the CICS SEND command to send the list of transactions to the screen. The program also uses the CICS RECEIVE command to receive user input from the screen. The program handles errors and exceptions using the CICS RESP and RESP2 commands.

The program references several other files, including COCOM01Y, COTRN00, COTTL01Y, CSDAT01Y, CSMSG01Y, CVTRA05Y, DFHAID, and DFHBMSCA. These files are likely COBOL modules that contain common code, data definitions, and other reusable components.
