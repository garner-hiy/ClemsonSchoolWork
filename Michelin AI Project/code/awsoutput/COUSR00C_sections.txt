This COBOL program can be broken down into the following sections:

1. **Identification Division**: This section contains the program identification information, including the program name, application name, type, and function.
2. **Environment Division**: This section contains configuration information, including the configuration section.
3. **Data Division**: This section defines the working storage section, which contains the variables and data structures used by the program.
4. **Procedure Division**: This section contains the main logic of the program, including the MAIN-PARA, PROCESS-ENTER-KEY, PROCESS-PF7-KEY, PROCESS-PF8-KEY, PROCESS-PAGE-FORWARD, PROCESS-PAGE-BACKWARD, POPULATE-USER-DATA, INITIALIZE-USER-DATA, RETURN-TO-PREV-SCREEN, SEND-USRLST-SCREEN, RECEIVE-USRLST-SCREEN, POPULATE-HEADER-INFO, STARTBR-USER-SEC-FILE, READNEXT-USER-SEC-FILE, READPREV-USER-SEC-FILE, and ENDBR-USER-SEC-FILE procedures.

The program appears to be a CICS (Customer Information Control System) COBOL program that lists all users from the USRSEC file. It uses a menu-driven interface to allow the user to select users, and it uses the CICS commands to interact with the file.

The program can be summarized as follows:

* The program starts by setting up the working storage section and initializing the variables.
* It then enters a loop where it waits for user input.
* Based on the user input, it performs different actions, such as selecting a user, listing the users, or returning to the previous screen.
* The program uses the CICS commands to interact with the USRSEC file, including starting a file, reading the next or previous record, and ending the file.
* The program also uses a header section to display the program name, application name, and other information.
* The program uses a footer section to display the current date and time.
* The program uses a menu-driven interface to allow the user to select users and perform other actions.
* The program uses the CICS commands to send and receive data to and from the screen.

Overall, the program appears to be a simple menu-driven program that allows the user to list and select users from a file, and it uses the CICS commands to interact with the file and the screen.
