I have summarized the provided COBOL code. 

The code appears to be a WICS (Warehouse Integration and Control System) program written in COBOL. It performs various tasks such as:

1. Initializing and binding database records
2. Processing shipments and invoices
3. Storing and retrieving data from various tables (e.g., WICSLOADS, MASTER-BOL, INVHDR-SHIP, etc.)
4. Handling errors and aborting the program if necessary
5. Sending messages to the internal reader and logging messages
6. Performing calculations and data conversions
7. Storing and retrieving data from various data structures (e.g., tables, lists, etc.)
8. Updating and modifying data in various tables and data structures
9. Checking and validating data
10. Handling special cases and edge conditions

The code is divided into several sections, including:

1. Identification Division
2. Configuration Section
3. Data Division
4. Working-Storage Section
5. General Purpose Statement (GPS)
6. Program Division
7. Linkage Section
