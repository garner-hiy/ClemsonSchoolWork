/*each problem is timed individually
when one times out it is locked and closed off
be mindful of the timer on the side
3-4 problems that range from 8-15 mins
Think about challange ativities and homework
Problems won't be too hard
Solve problem first, then worry about formatting
If code does not complie, it is fine because it will be hand graded
