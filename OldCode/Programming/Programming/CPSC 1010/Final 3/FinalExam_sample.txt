Congratulations! You actually looked at the sample text to test your program!

What is the best way to develop and work on this program? Be sure to incrementally develop. For example, can you read from a file and find the number of words, before moving on to the other code?

For reference, this file contains 65 words, 106 vowels, 2 periods, and 2 question marks.
