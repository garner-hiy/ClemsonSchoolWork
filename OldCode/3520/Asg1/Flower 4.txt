Flower garden 1D V4
Rules:
1) The garden consists of 1 row, each with N plantings (N is at least 4).
One flower species occupies each planting. The Row is horizontal
layed out with plantings from 0 at the left to N at the right. You
will use a Prolog list to represent the row.
3) Flowers have Name, Size, Wet/Dry, Color.
2) A given flower species can only be used once per row.
3) No two adjacent plantings can have the same color flower.
5) No two adjacent plantings can have flowers whose size is more than one
size difference. Sizes are small, med, tall so small next to small is
fine, small next to medium is fine, but small next to tall is not.
6) the two outermost plantings (1 and N) are dry, the two innermost are
wet, the ones in between (if there are any) can take either.
