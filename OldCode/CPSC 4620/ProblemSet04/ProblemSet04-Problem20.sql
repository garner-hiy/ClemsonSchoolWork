-- ## Problem 20
-- 
-- Write a query to display the book number and the number of times each book has been checked out. 
-- Do not include books that have never been checked out. Sort the results by the number of times
-- checked out in descending order and then by book number in descending order.

-- +----------+-------------------+
-- | BOOK_NUM | Times Checked Out |
-- +----------+-------------------+
-- |   5236   |        12         |
