-- ## Problem 1:
-- 
-- The House Development team wants to ensure that the default price of the extras should be 0
-- instead of NULL. Their calculation system doesn't work s resulted with errors when NULL values
-- are returned. You need to modify the ExtraPrice column in the EXTRA table so that the value 
-- defaults to zero.
-- 

ALTER TABLE EXTRA
MODIFY COLUMN ExtraPrice FLOAT DEFAULT 0;
