-- ## Problem 1
-- 
-- The InstantStay Channel Development team works together with channels in the platform to 
-- increase their potential and number of reservations. The Channel development team requires 
-- all the data available about the channels order alphabetically by name for their new dashboard 
-- team. 
-- 
-- Your results should look like this:
-- 
-- +-----------+---------------+-------------------+
-- | ChannelID |  ChannelName  | ChannelCommission |
-- +-----------+---------------+-------------------+
-- |     1     |  InstantStay  |        0.0        |
-- |     2     |   Newspaper   |       0.07        |
-- |     3     |  Online Ads   |       0.15        |
-- |     4     | Travel Agency |       0.13        |
