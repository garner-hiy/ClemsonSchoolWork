-- ## Problem 8:
-- 
-- The InstantStay Owner Relationships team focus on the success of InstantStay by creating strong
-- connection to the owners. They want to send celebration mails to the owners on their joining 
-- date in the system.
-- 
-- They need the combined details which includes name and last name of the owners with their email 
-- addresses. In addition, they are planning to make this as practice for every year. The team
-- requires the day and month of owners joining date to send emails on exact dates every year.
