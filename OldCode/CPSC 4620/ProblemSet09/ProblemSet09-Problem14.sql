CREATE TRIGGER trg_updatecustbalance2
AFTER DELETE ON INVOICE
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    UPDATE CUSTOMER
    SET CUST_BALANCE = CUST_BALANCE - OLD.INV_AMOUNT
    WHERE CUST_NUM = OLD.CUST_NUM;
END;

DELIMITER ;

DELETE FROM INVOICE WHERE INV_NUM = 9006;

SELECT * FROM CUSTOMER WHERE CUST_NUM = (SELECT CUST_NUM FROM INVOICE WHERE INV_NUM = 9006);
