-- ## Problem 4:
-- 
-- In a case wherein guests are canceling the reservations or altering their stay days, 
-- the respective reimbursements and cancellations payments are reflected with negative 
-- prices in the reservation tables. The InstantStay Finance team requires the list of Stay IDs,
-- GuestIDs, and the positive dollar amount rounded up to the nearest whole number.
