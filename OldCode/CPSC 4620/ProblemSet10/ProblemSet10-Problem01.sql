-- ## Problem 1
-- 
-- Create a trigger named trg_line_total to write the LINE_TOTAL value in the LINE table 
-- every time you add a new LINE row. The LINE_TOTAL value is the product of the LINE_UNITS 
-- and LINE_PRICE values.
-- 
-- Check your trigger code by inserting data into the LINE table and verifying that
-- the LINE_TOTAL field is updated apprporiately.
-- 
-- Make sure you include the appropriate DELIMITER statements in your solution!
