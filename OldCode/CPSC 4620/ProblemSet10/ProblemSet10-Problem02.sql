-- ## Problem 2
-- 
-- Create a trigger named trg_line_prod that automatically updates the quantity 
-- on hand (the P_QOH field) for each product sold after a new LINE row is added.
-- 
-- Check your trigger code by inserting data into the LINE table and verifying that
-- the Product table is updated apprporiately.
-- 
-- Make sure you include the appropriate DELIMITER statements in your solution!
