-- ## Problem 6
-- 
-- Modify the query used in Problem 5 to include the number of individual product purchases made 
-- by each customer. (In other words, if the customerâ€™s invoice is based on three products, 
-- one per LINE_NUMBER, you count three product purchases. Note that in the original invoice data,
-- customer 10011 generated three invoices, which contained a total of six lines, each representing
-- a product purchase.) 
-- 
-- Your results must match those shown below and be sorted by customer code.
