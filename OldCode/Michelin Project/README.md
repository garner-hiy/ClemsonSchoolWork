## Guidelines for Future Teams
1. **Follow the established folder structure** – Store new files in appropriate directories to maintain organization.
2. **Document changes thoroughly** – All significant changes should be documented in the `/docs/reports` folder with a clear description of the modification or addition.
3. **Keep code clean and modular** – To facilitate seamless handovers, ensure all code is modular, well-documented, and follows standard naming conventions.

By organizing this repository in this way, we aim to provide clarity for future teams and ensure a smooth handover process across semesters.
