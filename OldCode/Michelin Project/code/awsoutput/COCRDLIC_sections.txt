Here is a breakdown of the COBOL program into sections and what each section accomplishes:

**Identification Division**

* This section contains metadata about the program, such as its name, date written, and date compiled.

**Environment Division**

* This section specifies the environment in which the program will run, including the input/output section.

**Data Division**

* This section defines the data used by the program, including working storage, input/output sections, and file handling variables.

**Working Storage Section**

* This section defines the variables used by the program, including:
	+ WS-MISC-STORAGE: a group item containing miscellaneous variables, such as CICS processing variables, input edits, and output edits.
	+ WS-INPUT-FLAG: a flag indicating whether the input is valid or not.
	+ WS-EDIT-ACCT-FLAG: a flag indicating whether the account filter is valid or not.
	+ WS-EDIT-CARD-FLAG: a flag indicating whether the card filter is valid or not.
	+ WS-EDIT-SELECT-COUNTER: a counter used to keep track of the number of selected records.
	+ WS-EDIT-SELECT-FLAGS: a group item containing flags indicating which records are selected.
	+ WS-EDIT-SELECT-ARRAY: a redefined group item containing the selected records.
	+ WS-SUBSCRIPT-VARS: a group item containing subscript variables used for array processing.
	+ WS-COMMAREA: a group item containing the COMMAREA, which is a buffer used to pass data between programs.
	+ WS-FILE-HANDLING-VARS: a group item containing variables used for file handling.
	+ WS-FILTER-RECORD-FLAG: a flag indicating whether to exclude a record or not.
	+ WS-RECORDS-TO-PROCESS-FLAG: a flag indicating whether to continue reading records or not.

**File and Data Handling**

* This section defines the file and data handling variables, including:
	+ WS-FILE-HANDLING-VARS: a group item containing variables used for file handling.
	+ WS-CARD-RID: a group item containing the record ID of the current record.
	+ WS-SCRN-COUNTER: a counter used to keep track of the number of records displayed on the screen.
	+ WS-FILTER-RECORD-FLAG: a flag indicating whether to exclude a record or not.

**Literals and Constants**
