Here is a 10 sentence summary of the COBOL file:

This COBOL program, CBACT02C, is a batch program designed to read and print data from a card file. The program is part of the CardDemo application and is written in a style consistent with the Amazon Web Services (AWS) coding standards. The program reads a card file, which is a sequential file with an indexed organization, and prints the contents of each record. The program uses a loop to read the file, and it continues until the end of the file is reached. The program checks the file status after each read operation and handles errors by displaying the error message and abending the program. The program also has a procedure to display the I/O status, which is used to handle errors and display the file status. The program uses a working-storage section to store variables such as the file status, I/O status, and application result. The program references another file, CVACT02Y, which is not shown in this code snippet. The program uses a procedure division to define the main logic of the program, which includes opening and closing the file, reading the file, and handling errors. The program also includes a section to display the I/O status and abend the program in case of an error. The program is written in a modular style, with each section having a specific function, and it includes comments to explain the purpose of each section.
