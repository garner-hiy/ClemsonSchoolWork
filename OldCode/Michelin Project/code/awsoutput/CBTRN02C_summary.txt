Here is a 10 sentence summary of the COBOL file:

The COBOL program CBTRN02C is a batch program that posts records from a daily transaction file. The program is designed to read the daily transaction file, validate the transactions, and update the account and transaction balance files accordingly. The program uses several files, including the daily transaction file, transaction file, cross-reference file, daily rejects file, account file, and transaction balance file. The program performs various tasks, including opening and closing files, reading and writing records, and updating account and transaction balances. The program also includes several error handling routines to handle file I/O errors and other exceptions. The program uses a procedure division with several sections, including 0000-DALYTRAN-OPEN, 0100-TRANFILE-OPEN, 0200-XREFFILE-OPEN, and 0300-DALYREJS-OPEN, which open the files and set up the file status. The program then reads the daily transaction file and performs validations, including looking up the account and cross-reference files. The program updates the account and transaction balance files and writes the transactions to the transaction file. The program also writes any rejected transactions to the daily rejects file. The program closes the files and exits.

The program references several other files, including CVTRA06Y, CVTRA05Y, CVACT03Y, CVACT01Y, and CVTRA01Y, which are likely copybooks or include files that contain common code and data definitions. The program also uses several data structures, including the FD-TRAN-RECORD, FD-TRANFILE-REC, FD-XREFFILE-REC, and FD-ACCTFILE-REC, which define the layout of the records in the files.
