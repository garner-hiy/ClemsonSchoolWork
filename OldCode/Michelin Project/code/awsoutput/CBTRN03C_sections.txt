The COBOL file is broken down into the following sections:

**Header Section**

* This section contains metadata about the program, including its name, application, type, and function.
* It also includes copyright and licensing information.

**Identification Division**

* This section identifies the program and its author.

**Environment Division**

* This section defines the input/output parameters for the program, including the files to be accessed and their organization.

**File Control Section**

* This section specifies the files to be accessed and their file control parameters, such as the file status and access mode.

**Data Division**

* This section defines the data structures used by the program, including the file records and working storage variables.

**Working Storage Section**

* This section defines the working storage variables used by the program, including the date parameters, report variables, and I/O status variables.

**Procedure Division**

* This section contains the program logic, including the main processing loop, I/O operations, and error handling.

The main sections of the program are:

1. **Date Parameter Read**: Reads the date parameters from the date parameter file.
2. **Transaction File Processing**: Processes the transaction file, reading each record and performing the necessary operations.
3. **Report File Processing**: Writes the report to the report file.
4. **File Closing**: Closes the files used by the program.

The program uses various routines to perform I/O operations, such as reading and writing to files, and error handling.
