This COBOL program is an application that performs the following tasks:

1.  It reads data from a card file and an account master file based on the input account ID.
2.  It performs various edits on the data, including checking for valid account numbers, credit limits, and dates.
3.  It displays the data on a screen and allows the user to edit it.
4.  It checks the user's input for errors and validates the data.
5.  If the user confirms the changes, it updates the account and customer records in the database.

The program is divided into several sections:

1.  Identification Division: This section contains information about the program, such as its name, date written, and date compiled.
2.  Environment Division: This section defines the environment in which the program will run.
3.  Data Division: This section defines the data structures used by the program, including the working storage section, which contains variables used by the program.
4.  Procedure Division: This section contains the main logic of the program, including the main program, which is labeled as "0000-MAIN".
5.  Common routines: The program includes several common routines, such as date routines and error handling routines.

The program uses several data structures, including:

1.  WS-MISC-STORAGE: This working storage section contains miscellaneous variables used by the program.
2.  WS-COMMAREA: This working storage section contains the communication area used by the program.
3.  WS-THIS-PROGCOMMAREA: This working storage section contains the communication area used by the program.
4.  CACTUPAO: This data structure represents the screen data.
5.  ACUP-NEW-DETAILS: This data structure represents the new account details.
6.  ACUP-OLD-DETAILS: This data structure represents the old account details.
7.  WS-NON-KEY-FLAGS: This working storage section contains flags used to indicate whether certain fields have been edited.
8.  WS-FILE-READ-FLAGS: This working storage section contains flags used to indicate whether certain files have been read.
9.  WS-FILE-ERROR-MESSAGE: This working storage section contains the error message for file-related errors.
10. WS-RETURN-MSG: This working storage section contains the return message.
11. WS-RETURN-FLAG: This working storage section contains a flag used to indicate whether the return
