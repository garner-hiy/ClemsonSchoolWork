Here is a 10-sentence summary of the COBOL file:

This COBOL file, named COTRN01C, appears to be a CICS (Customer Information Control System) program designed to view a transaction from a file named TRANSACT. The program is part of the CardDemo application. It reads the TRANSACT file using the EXEC CICS READ command and displays the transaction details on the screen. The program also handles errors, such as when the transaction ID is not found or when there is an issue with the read operation. It uses various copy files (COCOM01Y, COTRN01, COTTL01Y, CSDAT01Y, CSMSG01Y, CVTRA05Y, DFHAID, and DFHBMSCA) to include common code and definitions. The program uses the DFHCOMMAREA to pass data between the program and the CICS environment. It has several procedures, including MAIN-PARA, PROCESS-ENTER-KEY, RETURN-TO-PREV-SCREEN, SEND-TRNVIEW-SCREEN, RECEIVE-TRNVIEW-SCREEN, POPULATE-HEADER-INFO, READ-TRANSACT-FILE, CLEAR-CURRENT-SCREEN, and INITIALIZE-ALL-FIELDS. The program uses various working storage variables to store data, such as WS-VARIABLES, WS-TRAN-ID, WS-TRAN-AMT, and WS-MESSAGE. The program is designed to be reentrant, meaning it can be called multiple times without losing its state. The program uses the EXEC CICS XCTL command to call other programs and the EXEC CICS SEND and RECEIVE commands to send and receive data to and from the screen. 

The file references several other files, including COCOM01Y, COTRN01, COTTL01Y, CSDAT01Y, CSMSG01Y, CVTRA05Y, DFHAID, and DFHBMSCA, which are likely copy files that contain common code and definitions.
