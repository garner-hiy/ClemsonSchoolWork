The COBOL program can be broken down into the following sections:

1. **Identification Division**: This section identifies the program, its author, and its purpose. It includes the program name, application name, type, and function.

2. **Environment Division**: This section specifies the configuration settings for the program, including the configuration section.

3. **Data Division**: This section defines the data used by the program, including working storage, file definitions, and linkage sections.

4. **Working Storage Section**: This section defines the variables used by the program, including WS-VARIABLES, which contains various fields such as WS-PGMNAME, WS-TRANID, WS-MESSAGE, and others.

5. **Linkage Section**: This section defines the data that is passed between the program and the operating system, including the DFHCOMMAREA.

6. **Procedure Division**: This section contains the main program logic, including the MAIN-PARA paragraph, which is the entry point of the program.

7. **MAIN-PARA**: This paragraph is the main program logic, which includes checking the EIBCALEN value to determine whether the program should process the signon screen or return to the calling program.

8. **PROCESS-ENTER-KEY**: This paragraph is called when the ENTER key is pressed, and it processes the user's input, including checking for valid user ID and password.

9. **SEND-SIGNON-SCREEN**: This paragraph sends the signon screen to the user, including the message and any other required information.

10. **SEND-PLAIN-TEXT**: This paragraph sends a plain text message to the user.

11. **POPULATE-HEADER-INFO**: This paragraph populates the header information for the signon screen, including the title, date, and time.

12. **READ-USER-SEC-FILE**: This paragraph reads the user security file and checks the user's credentials.

13. **XCTL**: This paragraph calls another program, either COADM01C or COMEN01C, based on the user's type.

The program's purpose is to handle the signon process for the CardDemo application, including prompting the user for a user ID and password, checking the user's credentials, and calling the appropriate program based on the user's type.
