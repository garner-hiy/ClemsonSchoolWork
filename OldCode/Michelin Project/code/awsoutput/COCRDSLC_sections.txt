This COBOL program is a CICS (Customer Information Control System) transaction program that handles credit card details requests. The program is divided into several sections:

1. **Identification Division**: This section contains metadata about the program, including its name, date written, and date compiled.

2. **Environment Division**: This section specifies the environment in which the program will run, including input/output sections and data divisions.

3. **Data Division**: This section defines the data structures used by the program, including working storage, input/output sections, and file definitions.

4. **Working Storage Section**: This section defines the variables used by the program to store data during execution, including input flags, error messages, and output variables.

5. **Input-Output Section**: This section defines the input/output operations performed by the program, including reading and writing to files and sending text to the screen.

6. **Procedure Division**: This section contains the main logic of the program, including the processing of input data, error handling, and output generation.

The program performs the following tasks:

*   It initializes variables and sets up the screen layout.
*   It receives input from the user and performs edits on the input data.
*   It reads data from a file based on the input data and performs error handling.
*   It sends output to the screen, including error messages and the results of the data read operation.
*   It handles abends and errors, including sending error messages to the screen and canceling the transaction.

The program uses several copybooks, including CVCRD01Y, COCOM01Y, DFHBMSCA, DFHAID, COTTL01Y, COCRDSL, CSDAT01Y, CSMSG01Y, CSMSG02Y, CSUSR01Y, CVACT01Y, CVACT02Y, CVACT03Y, and CVCUS01Y, which are likely custom-developed copybooks for the program.

The program also uses several IBM-supplied copybooks, including DFHBMSCA and DFHAID.

The program has several entry points, including 0000-MAIN, 1000-SEND-MAP, 2000-PROCESS-INPUTS, 9000-READ-DATA, and SEND-LONG-TEXT, which are called based on the input data and the state of the program.

Overall, this program is a complex CICS transaction program that handles credit card details requests and performs
