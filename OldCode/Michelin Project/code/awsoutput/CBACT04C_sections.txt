**Section 1: Identification Division**
         This section provides metadata about the COBOL program, including its name, application, type, and function.

         **Section 2: Environment Division**
         This section defines the environment in which the program will run, including file control statements that specify the files to be accessed and their access modes.

         **Section 3: Data Division**

         **Section 6: Program Execution**
         This section contains the program's main execution logic, which includes opening files, reading and processing transactions, computing interest and fees, and writing transaction records to the output file.

         **Section 7: Error Handling**
         This section contains routines for handling errors that may occur during file operations, such as file not found or file status errors.

         **Section 8: Utility Routines**
         This section contains utility routines for displaying file status, getting the current date and time, and converting the timestamp to a DB2-compatible format.
