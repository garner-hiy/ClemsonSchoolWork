The COBOL program is designed to process IDMS (Integrated Database Management System) transactions. The program appears to be a part of a larger system that handles Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) transactions, specifically EAI (Electronic Data Interchange) transactions.

The program, named DNWXP261, is written in COBOL and is designed to work with IDMS, a database management system developed by CA Technologies. The program is intended to be used in a mainframe environment, likely on an IBM-370 system.

The program's primary function is to retrieve and process EAI transactions from the IDMS database. It appears to be a requestor program that interacts with the IDMS database to retrieve EAI transactions, which are stored in the WICS-RECV-DATA and EAI-RECV-DATA datasets.

The program uses a combination of IDMS calls and COBOL code to perform the following tasks:

1.  It binds to the WICS-SOURCE and WICSRECV-HEADER datasets to retrieve information about the transactions.
2.  It binds to the WICSRECV-DETAIL dataset to retrieve the transaction details.
3.  It binds to the EAI-SOURCE and EAIRECV-HEADER datasets to retrieve information about the EAI transactions.
4.  It binds to the EAIRECV-DETAIL dataset to retrieve the EAI transaction details.
5.  It processes the transaction details and updates the WRB-RECORD-LENGTH and WRB-DATA-TRUNCATED variables.
6.  It checks for errors and sets the WRB-IDMS-ERROR flag if any errors occur.
7.  It takes a snapshot of the SUBSCHEMA-CTRL and WICSTRAN-REQUEST-BLOCK blocks and performs a ROLLBACK if an error occurs.

The program appears to be designed to handle both WICS (Warehouse Interface Control System) and EAI transactions, with separate logic for each type of transaction. The program uses a combination of IDMS calls and COBOL code to perform the necessary operations.

In summary, the program DNWXP261 is a COBOL program that processes EAI transactions from the IDMS database, using a combination of IDMS calls and COBOL code to retrieve and process the transactions.
