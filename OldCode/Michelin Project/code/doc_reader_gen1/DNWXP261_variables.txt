This is an IDMS (Interchange Management System) module that appears to be a transactional database management system. Here's a breakdown of the code:

**Main Program**

The program starts by performing some initialization checks, such as setting up the database and retrieving its status.

It then performs several procedures to bind databases to various sources (e.g., EAI source, EAI recv header, EAI recv detail), binds these databases to specific EAIREC (Electronic Application Interface) components, and sets up the EAIREC boundaries.

Next, it performs some checks to ensure that the database is ready for use, including checking the status of the WICSTRAN-STATUS record and setting up a snap of the SUBSCHEMA-CTRL block.

**Copy IDMS**

After performing the above steps, the program copies the IDMS data from the current database to another database named WICSDATA. This involves creating a new table in the target database with the same name as the source database (WICSTRAN-STATUS), and then loading the data into this new table.

**Eject**

Finally, the program eases out of the system by performing some exit routines, such as exiting special IDMS STATUS modules and updating various logs.

Some notable features and concepts in this code include:

* The use of IDMS-ERROR flag to indicate errors that occur during database operations.
* The creation of new tables in a target database using the COPY procedure.
* The use of snap and rollback procedures to manage database transactions and ensure data consistency.
* The definition of the WICSTRAN-REQUEST-BLOCK, WICSTRAN-ABORT, WICSTRAN-ABORT-EXIT, and WFV-SNAP-TITLE variables.

Overall, this code appears to be a comprehensive IDMS module that supports various database operations, transaction management, and data synchronization.
