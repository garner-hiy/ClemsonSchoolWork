14. WICSTRAN-ABORT SECTION
    Description: This section contains error handling logic for the program.
    File Description: This section contains error handling logic for the program.

The purpose of this file is to provide a COBOL program that interacts with an IDMS database, retrieving data and performing various operations such as binding, unbinding, and aborting. The program uses IDMS subschema names, translate function values, and source code to perform its operations. The program is designed to work with IDMS version 2.0 and is written in COBOL. The file is used to provide a snapshot of the program's state, including the IDMS-STATUS and IDMS-ERROR flags, and to roll back the program if an error occurs.
