This is a COBOL code file that appears to be a program written in the COBOL programming language. The program is named "DNWMX830" and is used for processing shipments and invoices. 

The code is divided into several sections, including the identification division, environment division, data division, and procedure division. 

The identification division contains information about the program, such as its name, author, and installation. 

The environment division specifies the configuration and mode of the program, including the source and object computers, protocol, and IDMS control section. 

The data division defines the data structures used by the program, including the schema, working storage, and record layouts. 

The procedure division contains the main logic of the program, which is divided into several sections, including the mainline, bind ready db, and process an entire transaction set. 

The mainline section initializes variables and performs various tasks, including binding records and areas, and performing a cycle of record receives. 

The bind ready db section binds various records and areas, including the load, bill-of-lading, freeform-items, shipment-header, coo-split, shipment-line, part-serial-num, route, route-details, master-bol, text-header, text-line, ar-invoice-hdr, ship-track-id, order-header, sales-order, sales-order-line, vas-line-item, so-line-schedule, customer, table-hdr, table-detail, pfo-ship-ooak, pfo-ship-tran, plant-master, carrier, and wics-loads. 

The process an entire transaction set section processes each record received from WICS. It performs various tasks, including checking for valid record types, processing the record, and handling errors. 

The program also contains several subroutines, including process-load, process-bol, process-ship-hdr, process-line, process-text, and process-xbrd-text. 

The process-load subroutine processes the "01" transaction type and generates a load number. 

The process-bol subroutine processes the "02" transaction type and stores a bill-of-lading. 

The process-ship-hdr subroutine processes the "03" transaction type and stores a shipment-header. 

The process-line subroutine processes the "04" transaction type and stores a shipment-line. 

The process-text subroutine processes the "03" and "04" transaction types and stores text records. 

The process-xbrd-text subroutine processes the
